# GNN Node Classification for Epidemics
This is the demo code for the semester project of ECE 382V Complex Networks in the Real World. 

Given the co-location networks recorded in Austin, TX throughout 2020, this project creates spatio-temporal graphs, simulates an SIR model based epidemic on these networks, and then, using these graphs, Graph Neural Network based algorithms are trained to predict the health labels, i.e. if an individual is susceptible, infected or recovered.
